/// **Nucleas** — High-performance, fine-grained reactive state for Dart &
/// Flutter.
///
/// Nucleas is a signal-based reactive runtime built around three primitives:
///
/// * [Atom] — mutable reactive state.
/// * [Computed] — lazily recomputed derived values.
/// * [Effect] — eager side-effects that re-run on dependency changes.
///
/// All reactive updates flow through a dependency graph managed by a
/// [ReactiveContext] and are batched via a lock-free ring-buffer
/// [Scheduler] for minimal allocation overhead.
///
/// ## Quick start
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:nucleas/nucleas.dart';
///
/// final count = Atom<int>(0);
/// final doubled = Computed(() => count.value() * 2);
///
/// Effect(() {
///   print('Doubled: ${doubled.value()}');
/// });
///
/// count.update((c) => c + 1); // Prints: Doubled: 2
/// ```
///
/// See the package README for a full guide.
