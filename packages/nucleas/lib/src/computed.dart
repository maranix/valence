/// A **lazily recomputed**, cached derived value within the reactive graph.
///
/// A [Computed] wraps a pure function that derives its value from one or more
/// upstream [Atom] or [Computed] nodes. Dependencies are tracked
/// automatically — the compute function is re-executed only when at least
/// one dependency has changed.
///
/// ## Lazy evaluation
///
/// Unlike [Effect], a [Computed] does **not** re-execute its function as soon
/// as a dependency changes. Instead, it marks itself as _dirty_ and defers
/// recomputation until the next time [value] is read. This avoids redundant
/// work when multiple upstream atoms change in the same update cycle.
///
/// ## Propagation
///
/// A [Computed] also acts as a provider: other [Computed] and [Effect] nodes
/// can depend on it. When a computed becomes dirty it propagates the
/// invalidation to its own dependents so that they too are scheduled for
/// re-evaluation.
///
/// ```dart
/// final price    = Atom<double>(10);
/// final quantity = Atom<int>(2);
///
/// final total = Computed(() => price.value() * quantity.value());
///
/// print(total.value()); // 20.0
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// Call [dispose] when the computed is no longer needed to unlink it from
/// the dependency graph.
