/// A reactive side-effect that re-runs whenever its dependencies change.
///
/// An [Effect] wraps a void function that reads reactive state ([Atom] and/or
/// [Computed] values). Dependencies are tracked automatically during
/// execution, and whenever any dependency changes, the function is scheduled
/// to run again.
///
/// Unlike [Computed], an effect is **eager** — it executes immediately during
/// construction and again on every dependency change (after the current
/// microtask flush), rather than deferring work until a read.
///
/// ## Typical uses
///
/// * Logging state changes
/// * Syncing state to external systems (network, local storage)
/// * Triggering UI rebuilds in Flutter
///
/// ```dart
/// final counter = Atom<int>(0);
///
/// Effect(() {
///   print('Counter is: ${counter.value()}');
/// });
///
/// counter.update((c) => c + 1); // Prints: Counter is: 1
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// Call [dispose] when the effect is no longer needed. This removes it from
/// the dependency graph and prevents future executions.
abstract interface class Effect implements SchedulableNode {
  /// Creates a new [Effect] that runs [effectFn].
  ///
  /// The function is invoked **immediately** during construction to establish
  /// initial dependencies and perform the first side-effect.
  ///
  /// If [context] is `null`, [defaultValenceContext] is used.

      _EffectImpl;

  /// Removes this effect from the dependency graph and prevents future
  /// executions.
  void dispose();
}

/// Default implementation of [Effect].
///
/// On each execution cycle, dependencies from the previous run are cleared
/// and re-established from scratch. This ensures that conditional branches
/// in the effect function produce accurate dependency sets.
